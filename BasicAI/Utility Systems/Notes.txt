Utility function
- calculate values of actions
- compare results and choose the one with highest value
Ex:
Desire to take cover = C1 * health missing - C2 * BulletsInMagazine + C3 * HealingPacks Remaining

- Values of the constants can be dynamically tweaked.
- ideally all variables (ex: health missing) are normalized to [-1,1] or [0,1]
- final values could also be scaled again to a [0,1] range for more readable compares
- the more options your npc has, the better this system is compared to the others
- very hard to tune and will have unexpected emerging behavior

- Alternative to selecting the highest, is to make a weighted random selection, 
so the best are the most likely descisions, but not always the choosen ones. Prevents mechanical behavior.
