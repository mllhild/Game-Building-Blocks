Uses a backwards recursive function to make an action plan.
- Hard to control and creates lose cannons
- bad for cienematic shots
- creates emergent behavior

- Derived from STRIPS
- Used in games like F.E.A.R., Deus Ex: H.R., Just Cause 2

Elements:
- List(Outstanding Facts)

Backwards chaining search:
Add the goal to the outstanding facts list
• For each outstanding fact
  • Remove this outstanding fact
  • Find the actions that have the fact as an effect
  • If the precondition of the action is satisfied,
    − Add the action to the plan,
    − Work backwards to add the now-supported action chain to the plan
  • Otherwise,
    − Add the preconditions of the action as outstanding facts

Ex:
Target.Dead -> HP reduce -> Shoot Target -> 
-> Have Gun -> Draw Gun -> Have Ammo Reload
-> See Target -> Find Target -> Move to Vantage Point -> Able to move -> Heal Leg
