# True random contains two sequence patterns which players consider unnatural and hence think the game is cheating
# 1. Clumping 10100100000000100101111
# 2. Patterns 11001100011100001111, 1100110011001100

# Rules to counter it
# 1. If the newest value will produce a run of 4 or more, then there is a 75% chance
# to flip the newest value. This doesnâ€™t make runs of 4 or more impossible, but progressively much less likely (the probability of a run of 4 occurring goes from 1/8
# to 1/128). Runs of a particular length can be prohibited altogether, but this will more negatively affect the integrity of the randomness.
# 2. If the newest value causes a repeating pattern of four values, like 11001100, then flip the last value (so that the sequence becomes 11001101).
# 3. If the newest value causes a repeating pattern of 111000 or 000111, then flip the last value.
